# Staying up to date

We continuously try to upgrade our internal processes and one of the key things about them is staying up to date with the technologies we use.

Browsing the web for tech news can be cumbersome and a fairly easier way is to subscribe to various newsletters that handout interesting content once in a while to our inbox.

## Ruby Newsletters

To stay up to date with Ruby we are subscribed to the following newsletters:

[RubyDrops](https://rubydrops.ongoodbits.com/) - our very own Nenad sends out a digest of news about Ruby, Rails (and beyond that) with a few thoroughly picked links to read on a weekly basis.

[Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) - the best resource for news in the Ruby world. It comes out every Thursday.

[This week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/) - An excellent lightweight weekly overview of patches and new features enrolled into Rails by various contributors. Comes out every Sunday, the same content can be found at [Ruby on Rails Weblog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/)

## Database Newsletters

We use stuff that goes beyond Ruby & Rails, primarily databases:

[DB Weekly](http://dbweekly.com/) - A weekly round-up of database technology news and articles covering new developments, SQL, NoSQL, document databases, graph databases, and more.

[Postgres Weekly](http://postgresweekly.com/) - Once a week e-mail round-up of PostgreSQL news and articles.

## Recommended Blogs

[Capsized Eight](https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/tags/ruby) - We run Capsized Eight, a blog about various technologies Infinum uses, and you can find a fair amount of Ruby/Rails blogposts.

[Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/) - Thoughbot is a software development consultancy with awesome posts.

[Signal v Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/) - Basecamps strong opinions and shared thoughts on design, business, and tech. Not so tied to Rails development, more of a tech philosophy blog.

[Arkency blog](blog.arkency.com) - Arkency is a Rails consultancy based in Poland and releases a fair amount of good blogposts.

## Reddit & Ruby Flow

Most of the stuff that you'll see in the RubyWeekly is curated from [RubyWeekly](http://www.rubyflow.com/), a community link log by Peter Cooper (the person behind RubyWeekly). That is probably the most resourceful Ruby page you'll see. 

There's also reddit, with the most resourceful subreddit being [r/ruby](reddit.com/r/ruby). There's also [r/rails](reddit.com/r/rails) but it's not as good as the r/ruby.


## Twitter

Good twitter accounts to follow for getting interesting information about Ruby and Rails (with none-to-little tweets that aren't tied to Ruby):

- [Ruby Slovenia](https://twitter.com/RubySlovenia)
- [Rails Bot](https://twitter.com/rails_bot)

## Sharing

When you find something that's interesting, do share it with the rest of the team on our teams email address. We'd love to hear what you find interesting! You can also drop it in our `#newsletter-rails` slack channel where Nenad curates content for RubyDrops.
