Every single project is different and you can always learn something new and useful. We found a way for developers to share their knowledge with each other.

Every few weeks we generate pairs for weekly code reviews. They usually last between 1 and 1.5 hours and we use that time to review each other's code from that week.

There are a few ways to review code:  

* going through commits
* going through pull requests
* showing some specific part of code we are proud of or we have problems with.

We give each other suggestions on how to improve the code, generally suggest better ways to solve something or even try to find the solution together.   

By switching over projects every few weeks we have a chance to get to know more projects and their code and learn a lot of new and exciting things.

You must have a code review every week and you can clock them under Internal/Education. When new code review pairs are generated, please remember to book a conference room for a few weeks in advance.
